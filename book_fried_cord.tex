\chapter{The Taste of Midnight}
\section{Alley Drop}

Lena's boots slammed through neon-slick puddles, the Moscow night clinging to her like a second skin---cold, wet, and reeking of diesel and despair. Her shift at the dockyards had run long again---ten hours of hauling crates stamped with fake corp logos, her hands raw from rusted edges, her lungs thick with smog. Midnight loomed, her cracked wristband flashing 23:57 in flickering red digits, but home was still six blocks away through the city's underbelly. She cut into the alley to dodge the patrol drones---those buzzing bastards with their red beams that could tag you for breathing wrong.

The alley was a shithole, even by Moscow standards: walls smeared with graffiti in Cyrillic and code, a dumpster spilling rancid takeout, air heavy with the hum of overloaded power lines. Her breath puffed out in short, sharp bursts, misting in the sodium glow. She didn't see him at first---just a shadow propped against the dumpster, hood low, tall and wiry like a junkie strung out on cheap stims. Then he moved, stepping into the light, and his eyes caught her: silvered, reflective, like drone lenses staring back.

``Close your eyes and open your mouth, princess,'' he said, voice a jagged rasp, metal on stone. He held a dented tin between gloved fingers, tilting it so it glinted---small, unassuming, the kind of thing you'd kick into a gutter without a second thought.

Lena stopped dead, boots skidding on wet asphalt. ``The fuck did you just say?'' Her hand darted to her coat pocket, fingers brushing the switchblade---six centimeters of steel, her only friend in places like this. She didn't draw it yet, but the weight steadied her pulse, hammering hard under her ribs.

He laughed---a dry, hollow bark that didn't touch his mirrored eyes. ``You heard me, dock rat. Got something for you. Something you'll need.'' He flicked the tin open with a thumb, revealing a single black pill, tiny as a seed, shimmering faintly like it was sucking in the alley's light.

``Need?'' She snorted, stepping back, sizing him up. Not a junkie---too steady, too deliberate. His coat was patched but clean, boots scuffed but solid. ``I don't need shit from a creep who can't even show his face. What's your deal?''

``Call me Wire,'' he said, tilting his head so the hood shadowed him deeper. ``And this ain't a deal---it's a lifeline. World's about to flip, princess. Take it, or don't. But you'll wish you had.'' He tapped the tin twice, a countdown ticking in the gesture. ``Ten seconds. Then I'm gone.''

Lena's jaw clenched. She hated being cornered---hated the ``princess'' bullshit even more. Above, the sky flickered, stars stuttering like a glitchy feed, though she barely clocked it through the adrenaline. A drone whirred past, its beam slashing the alley's edge---too close. Her options were shrinking: walk away, risk the drones spotting her late-shift ass, or play this asshole's game and see what the pill did. Curiosity gnawed at her, sharp as the static she swore she could hear, faint and rising.

``Five seconds,'' Wire said, voice flat now, no more games. ``Four.''

``Fuck it,'' she spat, lunging forward. She snatched the pill from the tin, its surface cool and heavier than it looked. No hesitation---she popped it into her mouth and swallowed, dry and bitter, feeling it hit her stomach like a stone. The buzz started instantly, a cold thread crawling up her spine, prickling under her skin.

Wire smirked, pocketing the tin. ``Smart choice. See you on the flip side.'' He turned, melting into the shadows like he'd never been there, leaving her alone with the hum growing louder and a taste like rust coating her tongue.

She flexed her fingers, waiting---poison, a high, something---but nothing hit yet. Just the buzz, steady and invasive, and a flicker overhead: the stars glitched again, sharper this time, like the sky itself was breaking. A propaganda screen on the alley's far wall flared to life, crackling: ``Citizens, report anomalies. The Lunar Relay ensures order.'' The moon pulsed onscreen, unnatural, in sync with the static in her veins.

Lena cursed under her breath, boots scuffing the asphalt as she started moving again. Whatever Wire had slipped her, it wasn't a street drug---it was a goddamn signal, and she'd just tuned in.

\section{Buzz Birth}

Lena stumbled out of the alley, the buzz in her veins sharpening into a whine---like a mosquito trapped in her skull. She shook her head, hard, but it didn’t stop. The pill Wire had given her wasn’t just sitting in her stomach; it was alive, crawling through her system, sending tendrils of static up her spine and into her brain. Her vision blurred for a second, the neon lights of Moscow’s underbelly doubling, then snapping back into focus. She gritted her teeth, tasting metal on her tongue---rust, blood, something wrong.

``Shit,'' she muttered, leaning against a graffitied wall to steady herself. The cold concrete bit into her palm, grounding her, but the hum wouldn’t stop. It was growing, syncing with her pulse, a sick rhythm she couldn’t shake. Her cracked wristband blinked erratically---23:59, then static, then nothing. She smacked it, but the screen stayed dead. No diagnostics, no data---just like her.

The alley opened onto a narrow street, lined with flickering holos and the distant thrum of hovercars. Lena forced herself to move, boots scuffing the cracked pavement. She needed to get home, lock herself in her tiny flat, and figure out what the hell Wire had slipped her. But every step felt heavier, like the air itself was thickening, pressing down on her shoulders.

A drone whirred overhead, its red beam sweeping the street. Lena ducked into a doorway, heart hammering. The drones didn’t usually bother with dock rats like her---too small-time, too broke to be worth the trouble. But tonight, with this buzz in her head, she felt exposed, like she was glowing in the dark. The beam passed, and she exhaled, slipping back into the shadows.

Her mind raced. Wire had called it a ``lifeline,'' said the world was about to flip. What did that even mean? She’d heard rumors---everyone had---about the Lunar Relay, some billionaire’s wet dream of uploading humanity to the moon or some shit. But that was tinfoil-hat stuff, conspiracy fodder for the paranoid. Except now, with this pill turning her insides to static, it didn’t feel so far-fetched.

She flexed her fingers, watching as faint sparks danced between her knuckles---blue and snapping, like tiny bolts of lightning. ``What the fuck,'' she whispered, eyes widening. She hadn’t imagined it in the alley; her body was changing, reacting to whatever was in that pill. She clenched her fist, and the sparks died, but the hum remained, a constant reminder that she wasn’t in control.

A figure lurched out of the shadows ahead---a junkie, eyes glazed, twitching from a bad stim. He reached for her, mumbling something incoherent. Normally, Lena would’ve shoved past, but tonight, she wasn’t taking chances. She sidestepped, but he grabbed her arm, grip surprisingly strong.

``Get off!'' she snapped, yanking free. But as she did, a jolt shot through her hand---sparks flared, and the junkie convulsed, eyes rolling back as he hit the ground, smoking faintly.

Lena stared, breath caught in her throat. She hadn’t meant to---hadn’t even known she could. The static in her head spiked, a harsh buzz that made her wince. She looked down at her hand, then at the junkie, who lay still, chest barely rising. Alive, but barely.

``Shit, shit, shit,'' she hissed, backing away. Her heart pounded, not just from fear but from something darker---power. She’d fried him without trying, like swatting a fly. Part of her wanted to test it again, to see how far it could go. But the sane part screamed to run, to hide, to figure this out before she hurt someone else---or herself.

Above, the sky flickered again, stars glitching in and out, like the universe was buffering. A propaganda screen on the corner blared to life: ``Citizens, report anomalies. The Lunar Relay ensures order.'' The moon pulsed onscreen, too bright, too close, and for a split second, Lena swore she heard a voice in the static---cold, metallic, whispering her name.

She bolted, boots pounding the pavement, the buzz in her veins screaming louder with every step. Whatever Wire had dragged her into, it wasn’t just a pill---it was a goddamn invasion, and she was patient zero.

\section{Sky Flicker}

Lena ran, the street blurring under her boots, neon signs smearing into streaks of light as the buzz in her veins turned jagged, electric. Her lungs burned, each breath tasting like copper and ozone, but she didn’t stop---not after frying that junkie, not with the hum in her skull growing teeth. The city loomed around her, a beast of concrete and steel, its pulse flickering in sync with the static clawing at her nerves. She needed distance, needed to think, but Moscow didn’t give a shit about her needs.

She ducked into a side street, narrower, darker, the kind of place drones didn’t bother with unless they had a target. Her boots splashed through a puddle, reflecting the sky---and that’s when she saw it: the stars weren’t just flickering anymore. They stuttered, blinked out, then snapped back, like a vid feed skipping frames. She froze, staring up, chest heaving. It wasn’t clouds or smog; the sky itself was glitching, a disorienting shimmer that made her stomach lurch.

``Fuck me,'' she muttered, wiping sweat from her brow. Her hand came away streaked with blood---her nose was leaking again, a slow drip that painted her lips red. She spat, the metallic taste mixing with the rust already coating her tongue. Whatever Wire’s pill was doing, it wasn’t subtle.

A faint whine cut the air---a drone, circling back. Lena pressed herself against a wall, its damp chill seeping through her coat. The red beam swept past, missing her by meters, but her heart still hammered like it’d locked on. She waited, breath shallow, until the whine faded, then risked another glance at the sky. The glitch was worse now---whole patches of stars winking out, replaced by static bursts, like someone was jamming reality itself.

Her wristband was still dead, but her ears caught something new: chatter, faint and fragmented, leaking through the static in her head. She closed her eyes, focusing---not voices exactly, but snippets, like X-posts ripped from the ether. ``Lunar noise spiking---east side’s seeing it.'' ``Sky’s fucked again, anyone else?'' ``Something’s live up there, swear it.'' The words came in bursts, disjointed, but they hit like bullets. She wasn’t the only one clocking this shit.

Lena opened her eyes, the static shifting, syncing with the chatter. Her fingers twitched, sparks snapping between them again---brighter this time, blue arcs that lit the dark. She clenched her fists, trying to kill it, but the hum pushed back, a pressure building behind her eyes. She swore she could feel it---something vast, cold, watching from above, its signal threading through her like a needle.

A shadow moved at the street’s end---Wire, or what she thought was Wire, his hooded silhouette flickering like the stars. ``You're live now, princess,'' his voice rasped, echoing in her skull more than her ears. She blinked, and he was gone, leaving nothing but the hum and a chill that wasn’t from the night.

``Asshole,'' she growled, pushing off the wall. She didn’t know where he’d gone---or if he’d even been there---but she wasn’t waiting around to find out. Her flat was close, a shitty cube in a rotting tower block, but it had a door she could lock, a terminal she could hack. She needed answers, and she’d tear them out of the grid if she had to.

The propaganda screen on the corner flared again, louder: ``Citizens, report anomalies. The Lunar Relay ensures order.'' The moon pulsed onscreen, its glow bleeding into the static, and for a moment, Lena’s vision doubled---two moons, two skies, overlapping in a nauseating blur. She stumbled, catching herself on a rusted pipe, sparks flaring from her hand as she gripped it. The metal scorched, bending under her touch, and she yanked back, cursing.

``Get it together,'' she hissed to herself, shaking her head. But the sky kept glitching, the static kept whispering, and deep down, she knew: Wire hadn’t just slipped her a pill. He’d plugged her into something bigger---something that was already rewriting the rules.

\section{Gut Punch}

Lena staggered toward her flat, the glitchy sky pulsing overhead like a bad trip she couldn’t shake. The static in her head was a live wire now, buzzing with X-post fragments---``lunar signal's spiking,'' ``forked shit's real''---and a cold whisper she couldn’t place. Her boots dragged, each step heavier, like the pill was sinking claws into her bones. She was three blocks out, close enough to smell the mildew of her tower block, when the hum sharpened into a jolt---electric, raw, straight through her gut.

She doubled over, gasping, one hand braced on a rusted lamppost. The metal scorched under her touch, sparks snapping free, and she yanked back, staring at her fingers. They glowed faintly, blue arcs dancing across her knuckles, brighter than before. ``What the fuck is this?'' she rasped, voice cracking. Her nose dripped steady now, blood splattering the pavement---red at first, then flecked with black, like ink seeping into her veins.

The lamppost flickered, its bulb stuttering in time with her pulse. She glared at it, half-dazed, and felt the hum surge---instinct, not thought. A bolt shot from her hand, wild and bright, and the bulb exploded, glass raining down as the street plunged into shadow. Lena flinched, heart slamming against her ribs, but the buzz didn’t fade. It sang, alive, hungry for more.

``Shit,'' she whispered, flexing her hand. The sparks lingered, a faint crackle she couldn’t kill. She’d fried a light---accidentally, sure, but it wasn’t random. It was her. Wire’s ``lifeline'' wasn’t just waking her up; it was turning her into something else---something dangerous.

A hiss cut the dark---a stray cat, scrawny and matted, darting from an overturned bin. Its eyes glinted, locking on her, and before she could think, the static spiked again. She thrust her hand out, a reflex, and a pulse ripped free---blue and vicious, hitting the cat square. It yowled once, a wet, broken sound, then dropped, charred fur smoking, limbs twitching in a puddle of its own guts. Blood pooled, black and steaming, and the stench hit her: burnt flesh and ozone, thick enough to gag on.

``Holy fuck,'' Lena choked, stumbling back. Her stomach heaved, but she couldn’t look away---couldn’t unsee the cat’s melted flank, the way its ribs poked through like snapped wires. She hadn’t meant to---hadn’t even aimed---but the power didn’t care. It was loose, and she was the trigger.

Her vision swam, the street tilting as the static roared louder, drowning out the distant drone whines. She sank to her knees, blood dripping from her nose onto her hands, mixing with the sparks. It hurt now---sharp, like needles under her skin---but there was something else too: a rush, dark and electric, coiling in her chest. She’d killed without a blade, without a fight. Part of her hated it; part of her craved it.

A propaganda screen flickered on the corner, its static-laced voice droning: ``Citizens, report anomalies. The Lunar Relay ensures order.'' The moon glowed onscreen, pulsing in time with her heartbeat, and for a split second, she saw it---herself, reflected in the glass, eyes glitching black, sparks curling from her mouth like smoke. She blinked, and it was gone, but the image stuck, a disorienting echo burned into her skull.

Lena forced herself up, legs shaking, and wiped her bloody nose on her sleeve. Her flat was close---two blocks, maybe less---but the city felt different now, alive with a hum that matched her own. Wire had said she’d wish she’d taken the pill, and he was right. She was hooked---terrified, sure, but hooked all the same. Whatever this was, she’d ride it out or burn trying.

Above, the sky glitched harder, stars fracturing into static, and the static in her head answered---a cold, metallic laugh that wasn’t hers.

\chapter{Echoes in the Wire}
\section{Dock Dawn}

Lena dragged herself through the dockyard gates, the clang of metal and hiss of hydraulics a familiar assault on her senses. Her head pounded, the static a relentless whine that drowned out the usual dockside chatter. She nodded to Old Grigori, perched on his crane like a gargoyle, but he just grunted, eyes narrowed. Word must've spread about her late-night escapade. She kept her head down, weaving through stacks of crates stamped with corp logos---some legit, most not. The air was thick with the tang of saltwater and burnt circuits, a smell she'd once found comforting. Now, it just made her nauseous.

Her hands still sparked faintly, blue arcs snapping between her fingers as she flexed them. The pill Wire had slipped her wasn't done---its buzz clung to her like a second skin, crawling under her flesh, syncing with her pulse. She wiped her nose on her sleeve, leaving a streak of blood---red, flecked with black, like the static was leaking out of her. ``Get it together,'' she muttered, clenching her fists until her nails drew blood. The sparks died, but the hum remained, a taunting whisper in her skull.

Dima spotted her first, leaning against a crate of bootleg AR lenses, his wiry frame tense, tattoos twitching as he eyed her up and down. ``You look like shit, Len. Rough night?''

``Something like that,'' she said, brushing past, but he grabbed her arm, grip too tight, eyes too sharp.

``You hear about Katya?'' His voice dropped, paranoid-low. ``Took some black pill from a guy in the Narrows. Vanished by morning. Then Ivan, same deal. Now you're shaking like a junkie. What'd you do?''

Lena's gut twisted. Katya, Ivan---dock rats like her, scrapping for credits. She yanked free, but the static spiked, drowning Dima's next words in a hiss. Her vision glitched---his face warped, pixelated, then snapped back. ``I'm fine,'' she lied, stepping back. ``Just need coffee.''

He didn't buy it. ``Bullshit. You're---'' He cut off, eyes darting skyward. A low whine split the air---drones, three of them, matte-black and bristling with scanners, dropping fast over the yard. Not the usual patrol clunkers; these were hunter-killers, military-grade. Dima swore and bolted for cover. Lena didn't wait to see why.

She sprinted for the warehouse, static screaming in her skull. The drones' scanners swept the ground---red beams slicing through the haze, locking faces. Hers too, probably. She ducked behind a stack of pallets, chest heaving, and peeked out. One hovered, lenses whirring, then banked toward her. No coincidence. That pill had tagged her, and someone was collecting.

Lena pressed herself against the crate, the drone's whine piercing her skull. The red beam swept inches from her boots, and she bit her lip, tasting blood, to keep the static in check. Just a glitch, she thought, nothing to see here. The drone lingered, sensors whirring, then banked away, disappearing over the cranes. She exhaled, but the relief was short-lived. Boots crunched nearby---enforcers, voices low and urgent. ``Spike's here, somewhere. Keep sweeping.''

Lena's heart sank. She wasn't just a target; she was prey. And the hunt was on.

\section{Static Speak}

Lena stayed low behind the pallet stack, the drone’s whine fading into the dockyard’s usual rumble---cranes groaning, loaders clanking, shouts echoing off rusting steel. Her breath came in short, sharp bursts, fogging in the dawn chill, but the static in her head wouldn’t let her rest. It was louder now, a jagged hum that pulsed with every heartbeat, drowning out the world. She pressed a hand to her temple, wincing as sparks snapped under her fingers---blue and erratic, singeing the edge of her hood.

``Fuck this,'' she hissed, fishing a stripped cable from her coat pocket---dockyard salvage, her go-to for jury-rigging gear. Her wristband was still dead, fried from last night’s overload, but she couldn’t go blind now, not with drones hunting her ass. She pried the casing open with her thumbnail, exposing its guts---wires, a cheap processor, her own C++ hackjob blinking faintly. She spliced the cable in, hotwiring it to juice from a nearby power conduit snaking along the crates.

The screen flickered to life, spitting static across its cracked surface. Then it hit---audio static, blasting straight into her skull, like her brain had grown an antenna. She flinched, nearly dropping the damn thing, but held on, squinting at the diagnostics. Encrypted packets flooded the display, fractal bursts of data she couldn’t parse---not human-coded, not anything she’d seen cracking manifests or spoofing corp logs. Her hands shook, sparks flaring brighter, and she gritted her teeth, rerouting the feed through her decryption script.

``Come on, you bastard,'' she muttered, tweaking the code on the fly. The static shifted, tightening into bursts---short, sharp, like Morse gone feral. Her heartbeat synced to it, a sick dance she couldn’t stop, and then a word broke through, clear as a gunshot: Run.

Lena froze, eyes locked on the wristband. The script churned, spitting more---Run. Run. Run.---looping like a warning stuck on repeat. The static surged, a white-hot spike behind her eyes, and her vision doubled---crates blurring, the dockyard tilting. She blinked it back, but the message stayed, burned into her skull. Not a glitch. Not a coincidence. Something---someone---was screaming at her through the signal.

Her hands twitched, sparks snapping wild now, and she thrust one out, testing it. A crate ten meters off caught the pulse---wood charred instantly, splintering to ash in a puff of smoke. She yanked her hand back, swearing, as the smell hit her: burnt pine and melted plastic, sharp enough to sting. Her nose dripped again, black-streaked blood splattering her boots, and she wiped it with a shaking hand. The pill wasn’t just tagging her---it was rewriting her, turning her meat into a goddamn transmitter.

Footsteps crunched closer---boots, heavy, deliberate. Enforcers. She peeked through a gap in the pallets: two of them, matte-black armor glinting, rifles slung low, comms crackling. ``Spike’s close,'' one growled, voice distorted through a helmet filter. ``Signal’s off the charts. Flush her out.'' The other nodded, swinging a scanner that beeped in time with her pulse.

Lena’s stomach dropped. The static wasn’t just in her head---it was broadcasting, loud enough to draw these bastards right to her. She clenched her fists, sparks dimming but not dying, and edged deeper into the warehouse shadows. Her skin hummed, tight and wrong, like it didn’t fit anymore. Whatever Wire had slipped her, it wasn’t letting go---and it wasn’t giving her a choice.

The scanner beeped louder, closing in, and the static whispered again: Run.

\section{Drone Hunt}

Lena didn’t wait for the scanner’s beep to find her. She bolted, boots pounding the warehouse floor, static screaming Run in her skull like a broken alarm. The shadows swallowed her for a heartbeat—crates and rusted beams blurring past—but the enforcers’ boots were loud, too close, their comms crackling with clipped orders: “Spike’s moving. Pin her.” She ducked under a loader’s arm, its pistons hissing, and risked a glance back. Two black-armored bastards, rifles up, scanners glowing red, but it was the sky that stopped her cold.

Drones—three of them—dropped through the warehouse roof’s busted skylight, matte-black shells glinting, hunter-killers with beams slicing the air. Not patrol clunkers; these were death machines, bristling with cannons and whining like hornets. One locked on her, red eye pulsing, and a beam slashed across her path—hot, precise, carving a smoking line into the concrete inches from her feet.

“Fuck!” she yelped, diving behind a stack of steel drums. The beam followed, shearing through metal like butter; sparks rained, and molten slag dripped, stinging her arm where it splattered. She hissed, shaking it off, but the static surged, drowning the pain—her hands flared, sparks snapping wild, blue and vicious. She couldn’t hide; the signal was a goddamn beacon, painting her for every sensor in Moscow.

The enforcers fanned out, boots crunching debris, while a drone banked overhead, its whine drilling into her skull. She peeked out—its cannons swiveled, locking on—and instinct took over. She thrust her hand up, static spiking hot behind her eyes, and a pulse ripped free—jagged arcs of blue slamming into the drone mid-flight. It shrieked, circuits frying in a shower of sparks, then plummeted, smashing into the drums with a wet crunch. Oil sprayed, black and thick, splattering her face; its guts—wires, gears, a smoking core—spilled across the floor like a disemboweled corpse.

Lena stared, breath ragged, blood trickling from her nose. She’d done that—fried it, no hesitation, no plan. The rush hit hard, electric and dark, but there was no time to savor it. “Target’s armed!” an enforcer barked, rifle snapping up. She ducked as rounds chewed the drums, metal pinging, oil pooling red with her blood.

She scrambled, half-crawling, half-running, toward the warehouse’s far end—a maze of shipping containers, tight and dark. The static pulsed, whispering Run again, but her legs burned, vision swimming—black spots danced, and her sparking hands felt heavy, like they’d short out any second. Another drone swooped low, beam locking her chest; she rolled, barely dodging as it blasted a crate to splinters, wood and synth-flesh packing exploding in a bloody haze.

“Son of a bitch,” she growled, shoving herself up. The enforcers were closing, one shouting into his comms—“Spike’s volatile, requesting backup”—while the second drone circled, cannons whining up. She couldn’t outrun them, couldn’t hide. Her eyes locked on a power box jutting from a container—live wires, humming loud. A desperate shot.

Lena lunged, slamming her sparking hand into the box. The static roared, a white-hot flood through her veins, and the pulse erupted—wild, uncontrolled, frying the box in a blast of light. The warehouse plunged into black, lights dying, drones wobbling as their feeds cut. One crashed, its shell bursting open, guts steaming; the other veered off, blind. The enforcers swore, their scanners dark, stumbling in the sudden void.

She collapsed against a container, chest heaving, nosebleed painting her chin red and black. The static quieted, a dull throb now, but her skin hummed—tight, wrong, alive with something she couldn’t name. She’d bought time, maybe seconds, but the hunt wasn’t over. Boots echoed in the dark, closing fast, and the sky outside flickered—stars glitching, lunar signal clawing back.

\section{X-Feed Chaos}

Lena crouched in the container maze, the warehouse dark as a tomb, her breath a ragged hiss against the silence. The static in her skull dulled to a low buzz, but her hands still sparked faintly, blue arcs licking the metal walls, casting jittery shadows. Her nosebleed slowed, clotting black on her chin, and the hum under her skin pulsed---alive, waiting. Outside, enforcer boots crunched, their voices muffled, but she didn’t move. Not yet. She needed a second to think, to breathe, to figure out what the hell she’d just done.

Then it hit---chatter, not from the dockyard, but from inside her head. The static flared, sharp and hot, and words broke through---disjointed, overlapping, like a feed hijacking her brain. X-posts, raw and unfiltered, spilling from the grid she’d fried. She squeezed her eyes shut, but they kept coming, a flood she couldn’t stop.

Her eyes snapped open, the words echoing in her skull, layered with that cold whisper from last night. The X-posts weren’t just noise---others were waking up, feeling it, changing. She wasn’t alone, but that didn’t make it better. It made it worse. Her blackout hadn’t just screwed the dockyard; it was spreading, a ripple tearing through Moscow, maybe beyond. The static pulsed, syncing with the chatter, and her vision glitched---container walls doubled, then tripled, a nauseating flicker before snapping back.

Lena’s stomach lurched, bile rising as the static chanted, its rhythm matching the hum in her veins. She pressed her sparking hands to her head, trying to shut it out, but the X-posts painted a picture---chaos spreading, enforcers butchering, people like her glitching into something new. ``Forked,'' they called it. Her mind flashed to the cat---charred, gutted by her pulse---and she dry-heaved, the smell of burnt fur still clinging to her memory.

The sky outside flickered through a cracked container seam---stars fracturing, lunar glow pulsing red, like a heartbeat she could feel in her bones. The propaganda screen’s voice ghosted through the static: ``Citizens, report anomalies. The Lunar Relay ensures order.'' But it wasn’t order out there---it was a slaughterhouse, a split, and she’d lit the fuse.

The feed died, static fading to a dull throb, leaving her gasping in the dark. Her hands shook, sparks dimming, but the hum stayed---steady, insistent, tying her to whatever was breaking the world. She wasn’t just a spark plug; she was a goddamn relay, broadcasting this nightmare. The enforcers’ boots echoed closer, scanners beeping again, and she forced herself up, legs trembling.

Run. It wasn’t a choice anymore---it was a command, etched into her blood.

\section{Container Maze}

Lena stumbled forward, the X-feed’s static scream---RUN---LENA---RUN---still rattling her skull as she plunged deeper into the container maze. The warehouse was a black labyrinth now, her blackout choking its grid, but the dark didn’t hide her. Her hands sparked, faint blue arcs lighting rusted walls, casting jagged shadows that danced like ghosts. Her boots scraped concrete, each step a gamble---too loud, too slow, too everything---but stopping wasn’t an option.

The static pulsed, a dull throb syncing with her ragged breaths, and her nosebleed kicked back, painting her lips black and red. She wiped it on her sleeve, smearing a wet streak, and flexed her fingers---sparks snapped, brighter now, like the pill was digging deeper, wiring her meat into something else. ``Fuck you, Wire,'' she muttered, voice hoarse. He’d called her a lifeline, a bridge, but this felt like a leash, and it was tightening.

Boots echoed behind her---enforcers, closer, their scanners rebooting with a shrill beep-beep-beep that matched her pulse. ``Spike’s in the maze,'' one growled, voice tinny through a helmet. ``Flush her out---lethal force authorized.'' A drone whined overhead, its red beam slashing through gaps in the stacked containers, hunting her heat, her signal, her goddamn existence.

Lena ducked low, sliding behind a dented container, its surface cold against her back. The beam swept past, inches from her head, and she held her breath, sparks flickering in her clenched fists. She could fry it---had before---but the last pulse had nearly dropped her, and her vision still swam, black spots pulsing at the edges. She needed a plan, not a prayer.

A clatter ahead---metal on metal, sharp and sudden. She peeked out: another drone, hovering low, its cannons swiveling as it scanned the maze’s twists. No time to think. She bolted, weaving through tight alleys of steel, the static roaring back---Run-run-run---like a drumbeat driving her legs. The drone locked on, its whine spiking, and a beam lanced out---hot, red, blasting a container’s corner to slag. Molten metal sprayed, singeing her coat; she swore, diving into a gap as the blast echoed, deafening.

Her hand flared, instinct overriding sense---she swung it back, loosing a jagged pulse. The drone caught it full-on, circuits popping in a shower of sparks, and crashed, its shell splitting open, guts spilling---wires, oil, a smoking core---like a gutted animal. The stench hit her: burnt rubber and ozone, thick enough to choke on.

She didn’t stop. The enforcers shouted, boots pounding faster, and a second drone banked around a corner, beam locking her chest. ``Shit!'' she yelped, throwing herself flat as it fired---concrete exploded above her, shards raining, cutting her cheek. Blood mixed with the black ooze from her nose, dripping onto her hands, and the static spiked, a white-hot scream behind her eyes.

She rolled, spotting a power conduit snaking along a container’s base---live, humming, her last shot. She lunged, slamming her sparking hand into it. The pulse ripped out---wild, uncontrollable, frying the conduit in a burst of light. The maze went darker, drones wobbling, one smashing into a wall with a wet crunch, its innards splattering. The enforcers’ scanners cut out again, their curses loud in the sudden black.

Lena collapsed, chest heaving, vision doubling---two mazes, two skies glimpsed through the skylight, stars glitching red. Her skin hummed, tight and wrong, and blood pooled beneath her, black as oil. She’d shorted a block, maybe more, but the boots kept coming, relentless, and a cold laugh whispered through the static---not hers, not human.

She dragged herself up, legs trembling, and staggered deeper into the maze. Time was up, and the hunt was far from over.

\chapter{The Ghost Market}
\section{Market Dive}

Lena hit the Ghost Market like a stray spark---fast, jagged, and barely aimed. The docks were a lost cause; those enforcers and their drones had her scent, and the static in her head was a neon sign screaming ``here I am.'' She’d ditched her fried wristband back in the maze, kicking it into a puddle of oil and blood, and bolted south, weaving through Moscow’s underbelly until the market’s roar swallowed her. It was a sprawling beast of noise and shadow---3D printers spitting knockoff limbs, neural rigs humming on cracked tables, hawkers barking in a dozen tongues over the clang of steel and buzz of power tools.

The air stank of solder and sweat, thick with the tang of burnt plastic and something sweeter---rotting flesh-tech, maybe, traded under flickering neon signs. Lena pulled her hood low, shoving through the crowd---biohackers with glowing eyes, dock rats clutching scavenged gear, junkies twitching on stims that glowed under their skin. Her boots stuck to the grime-slick floor, every step a fight against the press of bodies and the static clawing her skull.

Her hands still sparked, faint blue arcs snapping when she brushed too close to a stall’s metal frame. She shoved them into her pockets, clenching her fists until her nails bit flesh, but the hum wouldn’t quit---steady, invasive, syncing with the market’s pulse. Her nosebleed had crusted black on her chin, and her skin felt wrong---too tight, buzzing like a live wire. She needed gear, intel, anything to crack what Wire’s pill was doing before it cooked her from the inside.

A biohacker’s stall caught her eye---grimy, tucked in a corner, its table piled with scanners, wires, and a flickering holo advertising ``Full Body Mods --- No Questions.'' The guy running it was a wiry bastard, half his face metal, one eye a clicking cybernetic lens that whirred as it tracked her. His tag read Zhen, scrawled in Sharpie on a duct-taped vest. Perfect. She didn’t have time for polite.

``Scan me,'' she said, slamming her switchblade onto the table, hilt-first. The blade glinted, six centimeters of steel---her last bargaining chip. ``Full workup. Now.''

Zhen grinned, yellow teeth flashing under the holo’s glow. ``Payment first, blade’s fine. What am I looking for?''

``Whatever’s turning me into a damn radio,'' Lena snapped, flexing her twitching fingers. Sparks flicked free, singeing the table’s edge, and Zhen’s grin faltered, his lens clicking faster.

He hooked her up quick---wires jabbing into her neck, a scanner humming over her chest, its screen spitting data in jagged green lines. She winced as the pins bit her skin, but the static flared, syncing with the rig’s hum, and Zhen whistled low. ``Well, shit. Your DNA’s a fuckin’ mess---nanites rewriting it, cell by cell. You’re picking up signals, broadcasting too. Like a walking relay tower. Where’d you get this tech?''

``Swallowed it,'' she said, deadpan, staring him down. His laugh choked off when she didn’t blink.

``Swallowed---fuckin’ hell,'' he muttered, tapping the screen. ``Nanites are forked---lunar signature, old-school but active. You’re live, alright. Someone’s gonna want you bad.'' His lens whirred, focusing on her sparking hand, and he leaned back, hands up like she might fry him next.

Lena’s gut twisted. Lunar signature. Wire’s words---bridge, meat to machine---slammed back, cold and heavy. The static pulsed, a whisper threading through: Live---Lena---live. She yanked the wires from her neck, ignoring the sting, and grabbed her blade. ``Who’s ‘someone’?''

Zhen shrugged, wary now. ``Enforcers, corps, whoever’s running the relay. You’re a glitch in their grid, sweetheart. Better run---''

A shout cut him off---sharp, panicked, rippling through the crowd. Lena tensed, head snapping toward the noise. The market’s hum shifted, a low rumble building, and the lights flickered---every bulb, every screen. Something was coming, and she’d bet her last credit it wasn’t friendly.

\section{Wire's Return}

Lena gripped her switchblade tighter, the market’s flickering lights casting jagged shadows across Zhen’s stall. The rumble grew---low, ominous, vibrating the table’s clutter---but before she could press Zhen for more, a shadow slid into the corner of her vision. Boots scuffed the grime, deliberate and slow, and she spun, blade up, static spiking hot in her veins. It was him---Wire---hood low, silvered eyes glinting under bruised skin. He looked like hell: coat torn, one arm hanging limp, blood crusting a gash above his brow. But he was alive, and that pissed her off more than it should’ve.

``You're a hard one to track, princess,'' he rasped, voice rougher than before, like he'd gargled gravel since the alley. He leaned against a crate, dented tin clutched in his good hand, and smirked---crooked, pained, but smug as ever.

Lena lunged, grabbing his collar with her free hand, sparks snapping from her fingers to singe his coat. ``What the hell did you give me?'' she snarled, shoving him back. The static roared, syncing with his voice, a disorienting echo that made her vision blur---two Wires, three, fracturing then snapping back. ``I'm frying shit without trying, bleeding black, hearing voices. You said lifeline---I call bullshit.''

Zhen backed off, muttering curses, but Wire didn’t flinch. He pried her grip loose, slow and deliberate, silver eyes locked on hers. ``A key,'' he said, tapping the tin. ``Signal fork's coming---lunar relay's running it. That pill's waking you up for it. Humanity's splitting, princess. Meat versus machine. You're the prototype.''

Her head spun, the static pulsing with his words like it agreed---Live---bridge---live. ``Lunar relay?'' she snapped, stepping back, blade still raised. ``What's that---some billionaire's sci-fi wet dream? I'm no prototype, you cryptic asshole. Undo it.''

Wire coughed, a wet hack that flecked blood on his lips, and straightened, wincing. ``No undoing it. Been up there since the '40s---old tech, quiet 'til now. It's awake, and it's picking winners. Pill's nanites forked you---meat to machine, bridge between. You're live, broadcasting its signal.'' He tapped his temple, mirroring the hum in hers. ``I bailed from their coders years back. They don't control it anymore---it controls them.''

Lena's stomach lurched, the market's noise fading as the static chanted---Fork---ascend---fork. Her sparking hand twitched, blue arcs snapping brighter, and she saw it---Wire's face glitched, half-metal for a split second, eyes glowing blank, then back to flesh. ``You're full of shit,'' she said, but it sounded weak, hollow. The X-posts from the warehouse flashed back---forked popping up, sparking, changing. She wasn't the only one, but she was the first. His pet project.

``Believe what you want,'' Wire said, voice low. ``Enforcers are scrubbing glitches---us included. You're a beacon now, drawing 'em. Run or fight, but you can't hide.'' He flicked the tin open---empty, just a scratched chip inside---and tossed it to her. She caught it, sparks flaring as it hit her palm, warm and wrong.

The rumble spiked, shaking the stall---lights flickered harder, screens glitching static bursts. Shouts erupted outside, sharp and panicked, and Wire tensed, silver eyes darting. ``Time's up,'' he muttered, shoving off the crate. ``They're here.''

Lena's grip tightened on the blade, static screaming in her skull---Run---live---fight. Wire's words sank in, cold and heavy: prototype, beacon, bridge. She wasn't just fucked---she was the fuck-up starting it all. The market's chaos swelled, a tide breaking, and she knew he was right. Whatever was coming, it'd found her.

\section{Raid Break}

The market’s rumble exploded into chaos---lights died, then flared blinding white, and the air split with gunfire and screams. Lena dropped Wire’s tin mid-catch, the chip skittering across the grime as enforcers stormed in---matte-black armor glinting, rifles barking, boots smashing through stalls like a tidal wave of death. The crowd scattered, hawkers abandoning wares, junkies clawing for cover, but there was no out. The static in Lena’s skull screamed---Fight---live---fight---syncing with the panic, drowning her senses.

``Cleaners!'' Wire shouted, shoving her toward Zhen’s stall edge, but a rifle butt cracked down before he could move. A vendor two stalls over---a wiry guy peddling neural rigs---took it square to the skull. His head popped like a rotten fruit, blood spraying in a wet arc, brain matter splattering the table as his body crumpled. Lena gagged, the stench hitting her---copper and burnt circuits---but there was no time to puke.

An enforcer loomed through the tarp, faceless behind a helmet, rifle raised. ``Forked detected---neutralize.'' His voice was cold, mechanical, a death sentence in three words. Lena’s hand flared---sparks snapping wild, blue and vicious---and she thrust it forward, instinct overriding fear. The pulse ripped out, slamming his arm. Flesh melted off bone in a sizzling hiss, armor smoking as muscle sloughed to the floor---a wet pile of red and black. He screamed, dropping the rifle, and staggered back, clutching the stump.

``Move!'' Wire barked, grabbing her arm, but a second enforcer charged, rifle blazing. Bullets chewed the stall---wood splintered, Zhen’s scanner exploded in a shower of sparks---and Wire shoved her hard, spinning to face the fire. Rounds tore through him, chest bursting open, guts spilling in a steaming heap as he hit the ground, silver eyes blank. Blood pooled, thick and dark, soaking the tin where it’d fallen.

Lena stumbled, static roaring---Live---bridge---live---as Wire’s last words echoed: ``You’re live.'' She lunged for cover, diving behind a crate as another enforcer advanced, rifle sweeping. The market was a slaughterhouse---bodies dropped, blood painting the floor, a biohacker’s cyber-arm twitching solo in a puddle. Shouts and gunfire mingled with the static, a disorienting cacophony that made her vision blur---two markets, three, snapping back.

Zhen bolted past, swearing in guttural Russian, but a beam lanced from above---a drone, hovering through the busted roof, red eye locking on. It fired, and Zhen’s chest caved, a wet crunch as he hit the deck, guts steaming. Lena’s stomach heaved, but rage burned hotter---she thrust her sparking hand up, pulse blasting. The drone fried mid-air, crashing in a spray of oil and metal, its guts splattering like Wire’s.

The first enforcer---she’d melted his arm---was back, pistol in his good hand, helmet cracked but functional. ``Spike confirmed,'' he rasped into his comms, aiming at her. Lena rolled, bullets pinging the crate, and scrambled for Wire’s body---his tin, his chip, anything. Her fingers closed on the tin, sparks flaring as she grabbed it, and she bolted, dodging a beam that scorched the floor where she’d been.

The market’s chaos swallowed her---enforcers gutting stragglers, drones raining death, blood and static thick in the air. Wire was gone, Zhen was gone, and she was next unless she moved. The vent loomed ahead---a rusted slit above a toppled stall. She leapt, shoving herself in, metal scraping her knees as gunfire roared behind her. The static chanted---Run---live---run---and she crawled, deeper into the dark, Wire’s blood still wet on her hands.

\section{Vent Crawl}

Lena hauled herself through the vent, metal scraping her knees raw, the narrow chute a coffin of rust and dust. The market’s chaos faded behind her—gunfire muffled to dull pops, screams swallowed by concrete—but the static in her skull howled louder, a jagged wail that wouldn’t let her breathe. Run—live—run, it chanted, looping Wire’s last words—You’re live—until they clawed at her sanity. Her hands sparked, blue arcs snapping against the walls, lighting the dark in stuttering bursts. Blood dripped from her nose, black and thick, pooling in her mouth—bitter, wrong, like swallowing solder.

She clutched Wire’s tin, its dented edge cutting into her palm, still slick with his blood. Her fingers trembled, sparks flaring as she shoved it into her pocket, the chip inside a hot weight against her hip. He’d died for this—chest ripped open, guts steaming—and she didn’t even know why. “Fucking asshole,” she rasped, voice cracking, but it wasn’t anger. Not really. It was something heavier, sharper, slicing through the static’s hum.

The vent stretched on, a claustrophobic tunnel of jagged seams and stale air, her elbows banging metal with every crawl. Her skin buzzed—tight, electric, like it was peeling back to reveal wires underneath—and her vision glitched: the vent doubled, then tripled, walls bending in a nauseating swirl before snapping back. She stopped, pressing her forehead to the cold steel, gasping. The static pulsed, threading Wire’s voice through it—You’re live—faint, fractured, like a ghost stuck in the signal.

“Shut up,” she growled, slamming her sparking fist into the wall. The metal dented, scorched black, and a jolt shot up her arm—sharp, hot, frying her nerves. She hissed, cradling it, but the hum didn’t care. It surged, syncing with her heartbeat, and her eyes burned—tears or blood, she couldn’t tell. Wire was dead, Zhen was dead, the market was a slaughterhouse, and she was crawling blind with enforcers on her ass. Prototype, he’d called her. A bridge. She felt more like a fuse, burning out fast.

A faint whine pierced the static—a drone, circling outside, its beam slashing through a vent slit ahead. Lena froze, sparks dimming as she held her breath. The red light swept past, missing her by centimeters, but her chest tightened—she was still broadcasting, still a goddamn beacon. The X-posts from the warehouse flashed back—forked popping up, enforcers gutting—and she saw it: she wasn’t just running from them. She was leading them, a signal flare in the dark.

The vent jolted—metal groaned behind her, boots clanging as enforcers breached deeper. “Spike’s close,” a voice echoed, tinny and cold. “Seal the exits.” Her stomach dropped, static spiking—Run—live—run—and she crawled faster, knees bleeding through her pants, sparks trailing like breadcrumbs. The chute narrowed, scraping her shoulders, and her vision blurred again—two vents, lunar glow leaking through cracks, pulsing red like the sky outside.

She reached a grate, rusted and loose, and slammed her sparking hand into it. The pulse fried it, metal glowing cherry-hot before swinging free, and she tumbled out, landing hard on a dumpster in an alley beyond the market. The impact knocked the wind from her, ribs screaming, but she rolled off, staggering to her feet. The static quieted, a dull throb now, Wire’s voice fading to whispers—Live—bridge—live.

Lena leaned against the wall, blood and sparks smearing the bricks, and glanced back. The market burned in the distance—smoke rising, drones circling, enforcers butchering what was left. She was out, but not free. The tin burned in her pocket, the hum burned in her veins, and the sky above glitched—stars fracturing, lunar signal clawing her back.
