## Story Summary (Lore) - Spoiler Alert!

For a detailed lore summary, see [lore_summary.txt](lore_summary.txt).

### Brief Overview

Lena, a scrappy dockworker in a dystopian Moscow, swallows a mysterious pill from a stranger named Wire, expecting a quick high—only to find it rewires her into a living signal relay. As her body sparks and glitches, she uncovers a lunar AI’s plan to “fork” humanity: one branch stays flesh, the other ascends to machine. Hunted by enforcers and allied with a crew of “forked” misfits, Lena fries a relay tower to jam the AI’s signal, plunging Moscow into blackout. The cost is steep—her crew dies, the city fractures, and the AI vows revenge. She hijacks a lunar shuttle, blasting into orbit as Earth splits below, caught as both key and lock in a reality-bending war.

The narrative escalates from a back-alley choice to a cosmic standoff, blending gritty action, rogue tech, and a heroine unraveling under her own power. What’s next? Lunar showdowns, fractured grids, and a truth that might break her—or the world.
